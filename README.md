# --- Horse Race Tests: Source ---
Your favorite Twitter fad now in the Source Engine.

# Known Issues:
- This mod is dubiously unstable.
Something problematic is likely somewhere in the code, but the dumps fail to properly trace back to the true culprit. Frequently after compiling, you'll find that the game just crashes immediately after starting a race. Generally, this can be temporarily fixed by simply changing literally anything in the code, which I assume changes the way it's compiled into the binary, usually bringing it back into working order again. Atleast until it decides to start crashing again.

- The UI is unfinished (ie. Cannot select horses past a certain height on the screen).
I was planning on finishing everything first before releasing the mod, but after stagnating on it for a long time, I've just decided to release it regardless of the state it's in.
